The military strength of the U.S. and the brutality of Saddam's regime led them to imagine that the military and political victory would be relatively easy."}

It is more likely that the Iraq invading Kuwait scenario would fall under that assumption.. I think that the US government has come to a conclusion that we are on the verge of a war of religions, or more likely ideologies. It would be presumptuous to try and determent a one cause to the coming war. . I think that the world wide spread of the media with its many forms (Cable, Satellite, Internet, etc.)  have pushed the Moslem regimes to the extreme, fearing that secularity and democratic influence is penetrating their country and will result in an up raising against them. One of the best way to maintain the power that you have and even gain more of it, is by hatred. When the common man is occupied hating an outside enemy, its hatred is kept out side the county and would not be directed towards the regime. . So- I believe that the US understands that the fanatic Moslem regimes have already started a war on the democratic world and now is the time to try a fight it.. . So why invade Iraq? Because it is a huge, week Moslem country that thought to be easy to defeat. . This is exactly the same reason why Afghanistan was first and Syria is next in line."}

{"doc_id": "4193114_1", "text": "I'd like to take a different approach in answering this. I think geographical location and higher availability of other drinks probably is a bigger reason that water is not consumed as much by people in certain regions, including Europe. I believe and many visitors have commented that children drink less water and more soda in USA.  This is primarily due to the fact that soda companies advertise a lot, making it more attractive. Secondly, SODA IS ATTRACTIVE, and according to a few medical experts it's even addictive (yes, caffeine is addictive to some extent).  . . Secondly the cold weather in upper northern hemisphere in general is more of a reason that ppl drink less water and more of other drinks.  For example if you are from a tropical country or from a very humid place, you would probably & naturally  be drinking more water rather than if you are from   a country like Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland.. . Another reason is that people being less immune to impure water (like tap water) and being more dependent on bottled water makes the water less affordable and less available.  If you need to pay  extra or need to work harder to get the commodity, you may resort to cheaper commodity or a near by commodity.. . Another reason I also feel is the commute using Cars rather than walking or cycling.  If you walk more to commute (like walk to train stations, walk a few blocks to get groceries, etc.) then you are more likely to drink water when compared to driving to every place you go and exert yourself much less.  In many other countries people walk, walk and walk for several small things.. . Lack of education and awareness is also a reason for not consuming enough water. Not many people (except for few educated ones)know that 80% of our body is water.  Even if they knew, ppl forget that fact easily and resort to \"other drinks\".. . There are simply several reasons or combination of reasons for not consuming enough water by the people in general.. . Finally, after having said all this,. Beer Happens!"}

The cool thing about it is that the pollution can be outside of the city and not in the city.

{"doc_id": "1908421_1", "text": "The gas mileage for some hybrids is better in the city because they spend more time using their electric motor instead of their gas engine.  Most hybrids have battery packs which are charged by what is called \"generative breaking\".  Instead of slowing down with traditional braking, these cars store some of the energy from braking into a battery pack.  Then when the light changes and the car moves again, the energy stored in the battery can be used to move the car, or assist the engine in moving the car.. . In the city this effect can be more pronounced because of more frequent stopping and starting."}
{"doc_id": "1908421_2", "text": "There are the two reasons mentioned already - using the energy from the breaks and using the gas engine only when it can work efficiently.. . One more thing to note is that for several cars, the hybrid model of a car has a smaller gas engine than the regular models (e.g. for Honda Civic the gas engine for the hybrid model is 1.3L, which is not available in the regular models). So even without the other things, this engine will get better gas mileage than the larger engines."}

This relationship was critical to the development of atomic energy as it allowed physicists to determine the amount of energy that would be released because they could calculate the energy of the atom (from its mass) and compare it to the energy of its parts (protons, neutrons & electrons) by their masses. The difference was the energy contained in the binding of the parts, which as we know now, is huge."}

The keyboard and mouse have many a lot of advantages, and if you pitted a controller-player against a keyboard-and-mouse-player, the controller-player would be at a distinct disadvantage. . . All in all though, console makers and game developers have done a fantastic job of mapping FPS controls to hand-held controllers. It just takes practice. That and you may want to consider adjusting the look sensitivity for your controller.. . But I wouldn't worry too much. With the USB ports on the newer consoles that have hit (Xbox 360) or will be hitting (PS3) the market, you can expect to see some keyboards and mice coming out to appeal to PC gamers.. . As for the Nintendo Revolution's controller, I'm skeptical of how well it will work in practice. It's a great concept, but I think it will prove difficult to execute successfully enough not to become a niche feature.

All the western and Arabic countries supported Iraq, but Iran relied on it's people and won the war, even though it ended with a peace agreement, every one knows the winner of that war was Iran.. 3. Western countries won't let Israel attack Iran. Iran is one of the world's biggest suppliers of oil. The price of oil is currently about 60 dollars, with a war the price is going to be about 80-90 dollars, and it would cause unrecoverable damages to the economy of western countries.. 4. Iran is much larger than Israel and has a bigger and stronger army. The power of the armies of both countries almost matches up in air force, and navy. But iran has a much stronger Army. Israel is small so if Iran target Israel with missle, Israel will experience unrecoverable damages. But Israel can't target Iran with missles, and if it does it can't make that much of a damage.( Note the new anti missle and aircraft systems Iran bought from Russia, which covers the entire western parts of Iran.) . 5. There are alot of american forces around Iran that if Israel attacks and U.S. supports it, Iran can easily hit them. . 6. Iran has alot of allies around Israel. Syria, Lebanon, and even Palestine.. 7. People of Iran fully support it in war, even if they hate their government, the spirit of Iranians is that they won't let any foreign person or country rule over them, and as they did in the war between Iran and Iraq they will fully support their country in the war.. 8.

Both demonstrate that their old ways are left behind and they are embarking upon a new journey..  . Likewise, when a man is elected pope, he takes on a role that transcends his own humble past. He becomes a figure that is greater than who he was before. Sure, Pope Benedict XVI can remain Cardinal Ratzinger, but the pope is more than that person ever was and he represents more than just himself.. . Taking a new name has a long tradition within the Catholic Church, and even today many individuals will take confirmation names for that same reason of denoting \"a new life vocation.\""}

Those teaching high school, for instance, are mostly trained in the subject areas that they teach. (i.e. mathematics, science, etc.) It is my belief that many who teach at the high school level do not initially intend to be teachers but to be professionals in their chosen field. The learning to \"teach\" is secondary to knowing the specific  subject matter. . . Elementary teachers, on the other hand, are those who know going into college that they want to teach.  They are, for the most part, female, nurturing individuals who want to work with children. The \"subject matter\" of elementary education is teaching methodology.  Much of the curriculum is rudimentary.  For instance, adding three digit numbers is not complicated, however, the teaching of it to young children is the art. . .

{"doc_id": "3228020_3", "text": "This is an extremely serious condition for a cat.  The result of not treating it swiftly can be deafness for the cat.. . I got my cat from a friend of a friend who owned a farm.  She was born there and probably spent a lot of time in the barn and outdoors in general. When I got her she had this black gunk in both her ears.. . I took her to the vet almost as soon as I got her, so I could get her shots and get her registered, checked out, and her checked out and find out anything I should know as a cat owner.  She was the first cat I had ever owned.. . He said the black stuff was ear mites and gave me some stuff for that.  I dutifully put that on her on my back patio in the mornings according to the directions that came with it.  The result was her ears got clean and stayed that way forever.  She suffered no loss of hearing as far as I can tell.  She comes when I call her name, just like a dog, in fact!. . My mom had a cat which she got from a shelter.  Eventually it passed on to my brother.  Before, it had been an indoor cat.  My brother decided it should be an outdoor cat.  At some point, the cat must have gotten ear mites.  Not sure if this was before anyone in our family had it or afterwards.  Whichever it was, the mite infestation must not have been caught and treated in time.  . . The cat is quite deaf.  It never responds when being called, even to look, when you are right there in the room with it.  It does not respond to loud noises at all, either.. . I know the annual checkups you take your cat to the vet for are kind of expensive but a big portion of that is for the shots, some of which they do not need every year anyway.  For example, my cat gets a 3 year rabies shot - so it does not need one every year.  So most years, the annual visit to vet is not as expensive as that one.. . If you are sure that the condition is caused by ear mites and you cannot afford to take the cat to the vet right now, at least get the medicine right away and apply it as directed.  I just looked, and PetSmart carries it.  There is probably a PetSmart near you and if not, it looks like you can order it from their web site.  It only costs $10.49 today.. . According to the second Source I have listed (kittencare.com) the mites could have moved from your cat to your house.  It sounds like they might move back again.  You might want to be on guard for that.. . I really encourage you to talk to a vet.. . Like I said, though both my cat and my brother's/mother's cat had the same condition - my cat has perfect hearing and the other cat is completely deaf.  The only difference was in the treatment they received.. . If you must skip the visit to the vet, or delay it, do not delay treating the ear mites at all!  Get the medicine for it and carefully use it as directed.. . Make sure you apply the miticide outside and make sure you dispose of whatever you apply it to your cats ears with outside as well.  Do not bring it back in your house to throw it away.  Do not wipe your cats ears inside. You might wipe the mites onto your floor and you really want to keep them outside.. . I am including a couple more links just so you will have more sources of information at your fingertips.  Might as well do all your research at once so you can act right away, without second thoughts or wishing you had more information.. . Good luck with the treatment and I hope your kitty gets well!. . The first step is spotting the mites and recognizing what they are, not just thinking it is dirt.. . You have done that, so now all that is left is the treatment and it is not hard to do.. . Make sure you hold your cat's head perfectly still while you apply the stuff.  Do not go in too far, either.. . She should be fine if you have caught the problem in time."}

As you can notice, when v is small, since c^2 is so huge, you get a miniscule decimal, and 1 minus that number is basically as small as 1.0000000000001 or something, and so time is not really affected. As v gets larger(it can never be the speed of light, then the denomonator would be zero) that fraction becomes closer to 1, so when you subtract it from one, the denomonator gets smaller and smaller, meaning t gets smaller(in order for t' to remain constant) this means that time slows down for the object moving at such velocities! This formula is correct, it is part of Einstein's theory of relativity, and I have had to derive it myself from ordinary mechanics formulas. . . According to the same factor, length also contracts. It has been observed in certain tiny particles coming to the earth's surface. These particles have a certain lifespan before they become unstable and decay. They are also moving at a certain speed. (which is very fast; close to the speed of light.) You should simply be able to calculate v=d/t (velocity=distance/time) to find out how far they would travel.

Truffles, in particular, are mycorrhizae. This is a type of fungi that forms a symbiotic relationship with the roots of plants. The fungi gets carbohydrates from the tree while helping the roots gather the nutrients they need from the soil. Unlike mushrooms, which have been cultivated successfully, truffles depend on this relationship to get energy and grow. This is a very complex environment to duplicate. . . \"Truffles\" the fungi (Tuber melanosporum, Tuber aestivum, et al.) should not be confused with \"truffles\" the chocolate candy or \"Truffles\" the dog, whose web page I found while looking for information. . . A number of things combine to make truffles very expensive:. . . Truffles are rare and difficult to find. Certain animals, such as pigs and squirrels, like truffles just as much as we do, putting us in competition with nature to gather them first. . Truffles are a seasonal crop that can only be harvested for a short period each year. . Fresh truffles can only be stored for a few weeks before loosing quality. . There are very limited places in the world (mostly in Europe) that are renowned for producing the \"best\" crops. Many of these areas have been destroyed by development and environmental damage. .

So, supposing you had a psychiatrist and reported some of the symptoms under the DSM, he/she may not decide you should be diagnosed with OCD, but still think you have some thoughts that resemble compulsive thinking. . . Use of the DSM is not designed for patients, and does not contain sufficient information about how likely or common a specific diagnosis is, and does not contain information about variations on the \"textbook\" case to be useful to a patient trying to compare the symptoms listed in the DSM to their everyday life.. . Medical doctors have a basic understanding of behavioral health. If you are worried about it, or worried about a friend, you should have them see their primary care doctor, and ask for a referral to a cognitive behavioral therapist who can through \"talk therapy\" -- and sometimes medication if it is deemed necessary -- help them or you understand your thought process more clearly. The doctor will keep what you say confidential as required by law.. . The DSM will certainly guide their decision-making, and you should report every behavior that might be relevant. Pre-diagnosing means that you will tend to not fully explain, and be misdiagnosed, underdiagnosed, or overdiagnosed.. .

So whenever the germ cell is activated and starts growing into the new organism, it is germination. It usually refers to when the baby root and stem start to push out from the seed capsule."}
{"doc_id": "2855289_1", "text": "The purpose of laboratory testing of seed germination is to assess seed quality or viability and to predict performance of the seed and seedling in the field. Seed processed for sale must be tested by a qualified laboratory under the Association of Official Seed Analysts Rules for testing seeds. Several different kinds of testing are available depending on the type of seed to be tested, the conditions of the test, and the potential uses of the seed. The most common tests are the warm germination test, cold germination test, accelerated aging test, and the tetrazolium test. Each test is designed to evaluate various qualities of the seed. Factors that can affect the performance of seed in germination tests include; diseased seed, old seed, mechanically damaged seed, seed stored under high moisture, and excessive heating of seed during storage or drying. In most cases a seed treatment will improve germination of seed only if the poor quality is due to seed-borne disease. . . The most common test is a warm germination test because it is required by seed laws to appear on the label. The percentage of germinating seed in a warm germination test must be printed on the label of the seed if it is to be sold as seed. Germination is defined as: \"the emergence and development from the seed embryo of those essential structures which are indicative of the ability to produce a normal plant under favorable conditions.\" The warm germination test reflects the stand producing potential of a seed lot under ideal planting conditions. Usually 400 seed from each seed lot are placed under moist conditions on blotters, rolled towels, or sand and maintained at 77 degrees F for about seven days. At the end of this period the seedlings are categorized as normal, abnormal, or diseased, and dead or hard seeds. The percentage germination is calculated from the number of normal seedlings from the total number of seeds evaluated. . . The cold germination test is designed to measure the ability of seeds to germinate under high soil-moisture content and low soil temperature. This vigor test simulates early season adverse field conditions and usually represents the lowest germination that would be expected from a seed lot planted under such conditions. Actual field germination would normally fall between the cold test result and that of the warm germination test. Seeds are planted in a sand-soil mix at high moisture content and maintained at 50 degrees F for seven days. The test is then placed at 77 degrees F for four days. The percentage of healthy seedlings that emerge at least one inch above the soil is reported. . . The accelerated aging test estimates the carryover potential of a seed lot in warehouse storage. The seeds are exposed to high temperatures and high relative humidity for short periods of time that cause seed deterioration. Seed are suspended over water in a chamber for 72 hours (wheat and soybeans) or 96 hours (corn) then tested in a standard warm germination test. This test only would be used on seed whose longevity was in question. . . The tetrazolium test is a \"quick test\" for seed lot viability. It is useful when an approximate germination percentage is needed immediately. Seeds are soaked overnight in water then treated with tetrazolium to give an indication of viable, abnormal, and dead seeds in the seed lot. This test will not detect seed-borne disease, thus is limited in its ability to estimate seed quality. This test is highly reliable for determining viable seed of corn, wheat, oats, barley, and other grasses. . . If growers wish to use bin-run seed and has not had a germination test conducted by a competent laboratory, they can get an approximate germination test using the following procedure in their own home. . . Place two paper towels in the bottom of a dish or tray, one on top of the other; wet the towels thoroughly and tilt the tray up on one end so that excess water runs off the tray.

{"doc_id": "2416505_0", "text": "I'm assuming this question is specific to the engine.. . This sort of depends on the bike...2 strokes are a little different than 4 strokes and I will address those separately.. . The key to break in on new motors is heat cycles.  New motors are not built with crappy tolerancing like older motors so your main concern is seating the rings properly.  This is done by putting the motor through a few heat cycles.  In race applications and when facilities are available, you would run the engine up to operating temperature and go full throttle through all gears then let it cool down completely.  This process would be done a few times.  The point is to put complete load on the engine when at proper operating temperature.  Remember, this is typical only for 'race' applications.. . For most normal users, you just ride it below the suggested rpm limit for a certain amount of mileage.  The theory is that this works similarly to the above.  You don't overstress the motor and you put an appropriate load on it.  It is good to vary the rpm during break-in.. . For two-strokes, you need to run a much more oil-rich mixture for proper lubrication.  After the suggested mileage, you can then switch the mixture to the normal ratio.. . Definitely, the owners manual will give you the 'recommended' method.  There is a lot of available data on why you break in motors in certain ways and why you don't.  The biggest concern is usually seating the rings so you don't get blow by."}

Peanut oil is great for frying (having a higher flash point than some other oils) but as already mentioned has a pretty strong flavor that you might not want in some contexts.  Vegetable oil is nearly always soybean oil and has the mildest flavor. . .  - Peanuts and, to a lesser extent, soybeans are common allergens.

It is the Confederate naval flag.. . Now, most who feel that the confederate flag should not be shown is they claim it represents slavery.. . First, allow me to make clear WHY the civil war came about.. . It was over representation.. . At the time, there was a disagreement on how people should be represented.  One side wanted 2 representatives per state. The other wanted it based on population.  . . The north had a heavy industrial center, the south agricultural.  the decisions of a president can affect, for good or for ill, either side.  The states with heavy industry were more numerous, while agricultural had a large population.. . Here you can see why the issue on representation came into effect. It would determine if the US would be an agricultural, or a industrial nation.. . As an interesting note, Southern lawmakers wanted the slave population counted for representation and have voting rights, in an effort to secure their domination over the government.  The Northern didnt want that, for same reason.  This is where the idea that every 3 slaves counted as 2 people for the purpose of representation.  Eventually this wasnt enough, and civil war was fought.. . Why was the emancipation proclomation made?  To be able to free the slave population to fight for northern interests.. . . So what then, did we get out of the civil war?. . 1. The beginnings of true freedom for all races. 2. a house of representatives, and the senate. 3. a nation that is a mix of agricultural and industrial.. . Instead of concentrating on the issue of slavery, which existed before the war, we should concentrate on what the civil war taught us, and the good that came from it.. . it comes down to this... If the civil war never happened, and the south never seceeded due to differences in how representation should be done, would slavery ever ended?"}

Well recognized to occur in the extremities, it also occurs in the abdomen, and some believe, in the intracranial cavity. The exact clinical conditions that define abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) are controversial; however, organ dysfunction caused by intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) is considered to be ACS.

Read all you can about the breed before you do. There is a lot of responsibllity in raising a GOOD pitt..   If this doesn't sound like fun, perhaps. you should consider an older dog.. .  Any dog is a HUGE responsibility and a lifetime commitment. Please be prepared for. the role of responsible dog ownership before taking the step and buying a puppy, or adopting a dog. Unfortunately, many people put more thought into buying a car, or a major household appliance than they do when considering adding a dog to their home.. A dog will be in your home for a long time. A dog is not an item, or a piece of furniture,   it is a family member you are adding. Please do not take this responsibility lightly. Unfortunately, we have come to live in a time of 'disposable' dogs, and people do not think twice before dumping, or abandoning an animal.  Be prepared for the role of RESPONSIBLE dog owner, and do not be a part of the problem.. . .  . Be Prepared for:.  . A few sleepless nights ignoring howling, crying & barking, until your puppy learns that this is his new home. . A lot of Carpet Cleaning, and wet spots. Puppies DO have accidents!! . A few damaged items around the house. Puppies DO chew, and are bound to damage/destroy at least one thing they were not supposed to have! . Babyproofing your home! Like a toddler, puppies find things that can hurt them!. You will need to hide wires, and keep potentially dangerous items like chocolates,. and cleaners out of reach. Adding a puppy is like bringing home a toddler, you MUST be prepared!!!! . Constant supervision. If you can't watch your puppy, crate your puppy. A crate is NOT a prison. It is more like a 'playpen'. Would you let your toddler stay home alone, or wander the house unattended?? . Boxer puppies can be particularly good at testing your patience. These are rambunctious, bold puppies who can be hard to tire out!! Some seem to be on the go CONSTANTLY. .  . . Also remember.......  . Puppies are much like babies. They need lots of interaction. If someone will not be at home most of the day, a puppy may be a poor choice for your family. . Puppies need to be taken outside many times during the day to reinforce housebreaking. You cannot blame a puppy for pottying in the house, if he/she isn't given enough chances to 'go' outside.  Adult dogs have better bladder control than puppies and can be expected to 'hold it' a bit longer, and are more capable of learning how to 'tell you' they have to go out! . Puppies need to be taught what is appropriate to chew on, and what is NOT an appropriate toy! Don't give your puppy an old shoe and then expect them to know the difference between the old shoes and your new pair of $80 tennis shoes. . Puppies need to be trained. Your puppy needs your time, and your patience to learn how they are supposed to behave. With no socialization or training, your puppy may NOT grow up to be an ideal companion. This is NOT the dogs fault, but more so, the owners for not socializing or training the dog when it was young. . Do you and your puppy a favor. LEARN about training, and ask your breeder for help if needed. Many of the 'old' methods of dog 'training' do nothing but RUIN a good dog. \"Sticking their nose in it\" does MUCH more harm than good.   A good training Book can help you learn how dogs think, and learn."}

You'll want to use something that doesn't have any scent & also look for something that is particularly gentle to the skin. There are some pretty good products out there for this sort of thing but I can't recall the name of any right now. Anyway, if the patches persist, you might need to see a dermatologist for some prescription cream until everything heals up nicely :). . Good luck!"}
